# ðŸš¦ Circuit Breaker (Theory)

## 1. What is a Circuit Breaker?

Think of a **traffic signal** outside a bridge:  

- **Green (Closed)** â†’ Cars pass normally. (Requests go to service)  
- **Red (Open)** â†’ Bridge broken â†’ Cars blocked. (Requests fail fast)  
- **Yellow (Half-Open)** â†’ A few cars tested.  
  - If safe â†’ turn back Green.  
  - If unsafe â†’ back to Red.  

### ðŸ–¥ In Software
- A circuit breaker protects your system when a **downstream service fails** repeatedly.  
- After threshold failures â†’ circuit **opens** and blocks calls.  
- After a cooldown â†’ it **half-opens** and allows a test call.  
- If test succeeds â†’ back to normal (**Closed**).  

### ðŸŽ¯ Why use it?
- Prevents **wasting resources** on failed calls.  
- Protects from **cascading failures**.  
- Helps the system **recover gracefully**.
