# 🔴 Why Cyclic Dependencies Are Bad

A **cyclic dependency** occurs when:  
- Module/Package/Class **A depends on B**, and  
- **B also depends on A** (directly or indirectly).  

## ⚡ Problems They Cause

### 1. Tight Coupling
- Neither module can evolve independently.  
- Any change in A forces changes in B, and vice versa.  
- Violates the **Single Responsibility Principle** and modular design.  

### 2. Poor Testability
- Unit tests often need to mock or isolate dependencies.  
- With cycles, you can’t test A without pulling in B (and possibly C, D…).  
- Makes mocking and stubbing painful.  

### 3. Harder Maintenance
- Refactoring becomes risky (small changes ripple through the cycle).  
- In large codebases, cycles lead to *spaghetti architecture*.  

### 4. Scalability and Team Productivity
- Different teams cannot work on A and B independently.  
- Merge conflicts increase, release cycles slow down.  

### 5. Build & Deployment Issues
- Many build systems (Maven, Gradle, Bazel) struggle with cyclic module dependencies.  
- Circular imports can cause **class loading issues** in Java.  

### 6. Runtime Bugs
- Cycles in dependency injection frameworks (Spring, Guice) cause:
  - `BeanCurrentlyInCreationException` (Spring)  
  - Deadlocks during initialization  
- In distributed systems, service-to-service cycles can cause **cascading failures**.  

## ✅ Example (Bad)
```java
// A depends on B
public class A {
    private B b;
}

// B depends on A
public class B {
    private A a;
}
```

👉 If you try to load both in Spring, you’ll hit a **circular dependency error** unless you break the cycle with lazy injection. 

## 🛠️ How to Avoid Cycles
- **Introduce an abstraction (interface)**:
  - A depends on `IB`, B depends on `IA`. Breaks the concrete cycle.  
- **Extract common functionality** into a **shared utility module**.  
- **Follow layered architecture**:  
  - e.g., Controller → Service → Repository.  
  - Dependencies should flow downward, never upward.  
- Use **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:
  - High-level modules depend on abstractions, not implementations.  

## 🎯 Interview Angle
If asked *“Why are cyclic dependencies bad?”*:  
1. Start with **tight coupling and testability**.  
2. Expand to **scalability and maintainability** in large teams.  
3. Mention **technical issues** (build systems, DI frameworks).  
4. Conclude with **how to break cycles** (abstractions, layering, interfaces).
